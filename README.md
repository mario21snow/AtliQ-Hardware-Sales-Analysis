- The marketing is growing dynamically 📈 and then he's struggling in terms of tracking the sales 📊, needing more accurate insights about the company sales 💡, and then take the necessary decisions 🤝.

### 🌟 Imagine the scenario:
- The sales director needs to know how the sales are going in all operations 🌐, and the information provided by the regional sales managers are not enough.
- Just hearing the numbers or receiving tons of excel files is far from being effective 📉 in terms of having a reliable overview of the business 📈.

## 💡 Solution 🌐
- Create a simple and informative dashboard about the company sales 📊.

## 🔄 Data Transformation in Power BI 📈
- Once the data is imported in Power BI, we do 'transform data' i.e. using Power Query editor to perform certain operations on the data 📊.
- Ensuring correct data types, creating custom/conditional columns are some fundamental tasks performed in Power Query 💪.

## 📊 Modeling Schema in Power BI 📉
- Created 'one to many' relationship models between dimension table and fact table using primary key 🔑 and foreign key 🔗 concepts.

## 📈 Created Measures 📊

- All these charts can be filtered using Year and Months slicer 📅.

## 🚀 Deployment in Power BI 📤
- In Power BI, You can directly publish the report online to your workstation 🖥️.
